## Project Structure

- `Simulator/` - Implementation of the multi-threaded simulator that runs multiple tank games in parallel.
- `Algorithm/` - Implementation of player logic and tank decision-making algorithms. 
- `GameManager/` - Implementation of the game manager, responsible for executing a single tank game.
- `common/` – Provided interfaces from the assignment (e.g. `TankAlgorithm`, `Player`, `SatelliteView`, `AbstractGameManager`); 
- `UserCommon/` -Shared code and interfaces developed by us, used across the Simulator, Algorithm, and GameManager projects.
- `CMakeLists.txt` – Root CMake configuration file for building the entire project, delegates to sub-project CMake files in `Simulator/`, `Algorithm/` and `GameManager/`.
- `tests/` – Unit tests written using Google Test to verify correctness of the modules.
- `docs/` - Folder containing all .md files.
- `MapChecker/` - Contains tools for validating and analyzing map files (checking dimensions, symbols, formatting, and statistics).
- `MapGenrator/` - Contains utilities for procedurally generating valid game maps, with customizable parameters (rows, columns, shells, etc.).
- `students.txt` - Text file with the contributors information.
